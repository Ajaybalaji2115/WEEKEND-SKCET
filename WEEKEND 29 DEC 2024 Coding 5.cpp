Problem Statement



The cities in a country are connected as a graph. There should be a path between all pairs of cities. We have to find the maximal strongly connected cities. Given a set of vertices and edges, write a program to identify the strongly connected components in a graph.



Strongly connected components in a graph are sets of vertices where each vertex in the set can be reached from every other vertex in the same set by following directed edges.

Input format :
The first line consists of the number of edges n.

The next n lines consist of two integers: a and b representing directed edges from vertex a to vertex b.

Output format :
The output prints the strongly connected components in the graph, each on a separate line.

The components are printed as space-separated integers representing the vertices in each component.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
0 ≤ a, b < n

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
1 0
0 2
2 1
0 3
3 4
Output 1 :
0 1 2 
3 
4 
Note :
The program will be evaluated only after the “Submit Code” is clicked.
Extra spaces and new line characters in the program output will result in the failure of the test case.
